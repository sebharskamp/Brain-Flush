## Intriguing Question
**How does a company delivers software with only one state of code in a microservice landscape without breaking stuff?**

- Why micro-services?
- Why only one state of code?
  - What does it imply?
- What about database migrations for all forms of data (structured, semi-structured or non-structured)?
- What about data contracts between systems (internal and external)?
- Is it all possible without versioning?
- What about the development practices?
  - Commit times
  - Commit frequencies
  - Local development
  - Debugging
  - Tests (unit, integrated)
  - To scrum or not scrum
  - Development phases? 
- What about security? 

## Resolution
### Why micro-services?
What is a micro-services? Well, I'm going to skip the wikis and books about this topic.
What if we split up the words. 

<ins>Micro</ins>
  
According to the [Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/micro) it is something very small.
Like a microorganism. 

<ins>Service</ins>

As a noun it is [an act of helpful activity](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/service).

So it is a very small organism that is providing an act of helpful activity. 
In other words, it is a system with a simple scope providing assistance in need of another system.
In my opinion, and from experience, it helps a lot to keep the scope small. It reduces head-space, 
space needed for critical thinking for that specific finite task.
The hardest part is defining the scope en isolating processes. However, if done well, it will make life easier. 
But wait... all those loosely coupled systems? It is complex!
True, it can be. How to coop with that is out of scope for this document. 
I'll try to come back on this topic in a separate document.
So in context of this document.
```
By defining boundaries, it makes lives easier. Easier to release chunks independently of each other. 
Improving the I in the team with respect to the team.
```
